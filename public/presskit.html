      <h3 class="logo-yellow text-center">About Memphis Kee</h3>
      <hr />
      <p class="text-center my-5 mx-auto">
        Memphis Kee knows exactly what they are — and what they’re not. They’re
        not trend-chasers or opportunists looking for a quick payoff. They’re
        veterans of a music scene that blends country grit with rock energy.
        Intricacy and force. Lyricism and feel. Oklahoma and Texas. As more
        rock-edged Red Dirt makes a resurgence, Memphis Kee has been firmly and
        confidently planted on the front lines, perfecting this sound — not
        adopting it. This powerhouse Austin-based quintet has spent the past
        several years building a loyal fanbase and touring on the strength of
        the overwhelmingly positive reception to their previous LP, Wimberley.
        Now, with the release of their highly anticipated sophomore album, they
        showcase Kee’s powerful vocals and sharply aware songwriting, backed by
        the band’s technical skill and sonic agility. Memphis Kee is poised to
        stand out in this compelling new generation of Red Dirt acts.
        <br />
        <br />
        The band’s new album, Dark Skies, showcases the evolution of their sound
        and perspective. A follow-up to the band’s initial EP, 6th & San
        Jacinto, and their first full length effort, their widely acclaimed
        album Wimberley, it is a clear step forward from those releases that
        came before.
        <br />
        <br />
        Recorded at Yellow DOG Studios in San Marcos Texas, Dark Skies was
        produced by Grammy Award-winner Adam Odor, engineered by Casey Johns and
        Ethan Lugbauer, mixed by Kevin Szymanski, and mastered by Eric Conn. The
        band’s line-up includes Memphis Kee (lead vocals, rhythm guitar),
        Spencer Carlson (lead guitar, harp, vocals), Paul Pinon (drums), Joey
        Sisk (bass), Chris Loyd (keys, guitar, vocals) and Jake Waylon (second
        guitar, keys, organ, harmonica, mandolin, and harmony vocals). Jamie Lin
        Wilson lends co-lead, background vocals and a co-write to the song
        “Bewitched.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Kee explains that the The Dark Skies concept is essentially twofold —
        one negative and one positive. “Things are very ominous in the world
        lately, things seem uncertain, and it's been hard on a lot of people,”
        he continues. “So I think that's part of the shift in tone and the
        subject matter. But, there’s a brighter side. My seven-year-old daughter
        McKinley and I share a deep connection through our love of space.. If
        you listen to the record, you’ll see there's some sort of celestial or
        skyward reference in every song. Some are literal or figurative, and
        some are deeper, talking about time moving forward at different speeds.”
        <br />
        <br />
        The music runs the gamut, from the steady strides of “I’ll Come Runnin,”
        “Pedro,” and “Starting Over,” to the decisive determination that drives
        “All the Rest,” the discontent that underscores “With None” and
        eventually, the raucous shredding and workingman’s worry of “Twenty
        Dollar Chain.” On the other hand, it offers the seductive strains that
        emanate from Kee and the immensely talented and respected Wilson on
        “Bewitched,” the meditative mood and hypnotizing harmonies of
        “Hummingbird,” the down home desire, depression and desperation shared
        with “Black Butterfly,” and ultimately, the sheer heartbreak expressed
        in “Being A Kid.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Kee points to “Hummingbird” as a standout. “It’s a relationship song,
        really about the wreckage of forbidden love and infidelities,” he says.
        He also credits his daughter for helping on ‘Black Butterfly.’ She hears
        all my new songs first,” he says. “I was stuck on the bridge, and she
        suggested, ‘Daddy, why don’t you just sing fly away?’ I knew immediately
        it was the right choice. McKinley is now a credited songwriter on the
        record — and I don’t know who’s prouder, her or me.”
        <br />
        <br />
        That brings him to the track titled “Being A Kid,” which was written in
        the aftermath of the horrific school shooting in Uvalde,Texas. The song
        describes his feelings as his daughter began her first day of school and
        the trepidation that any parent might feel given the terrible
        possibilities that impact even the youngest victims. The song evoked
        such raw emotions from everyone that heard it that Kee considered
        putting it out as a solo song until he was convinced by his bandmates
        that it belonged on Dark Skies.
        <br />
        <br />
        Formed in 2020, Memphis Kee have always shown the ability to connect
        with their audiences. Early on, they honed their skills on the live
        circuit with propulsive performances that found them pulling from a
        diverse catalog of raucous barroom country, classic stories of love and
        loss and even gritty old-school murder ballads.
        <br />
        <br />
        They’ve also earned critical praise along the way. Saving Country Music
        named Wimberley an Essential Album of 2022, noting Memphis’ “intensely
        personal stories” delivered with “a country rock wallop” and comparing
        his approach to Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt. Whiskey Riff called him
        “the red dirt rocker [with] all of the tools to be a household name,”
        while Country Music France declared, “Wimberley is absolutely
        brilliant.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Raised in Memphis, TN, Kee taught himself bass while attending the
        University of Memphis, where he co-founded the band Rambus. A 2002 South
        by Southwest performance brought him to Austin, now his home, and
        inspired his debut EP, 6th and San Jacinto.
        <br />
        <br />
        With ten years as a detective and six as a PI, his work on cold cases
        and undercover ops gave him insights that now fuel his songwriting.
        <br />
        <br />
        The lineup began in 2019 when Joey Sisk joined after his band opened for
        Kee, soon followed by Spencer Carlson, who clicked with Kee at an open
        mic. Paul Pinon came aboard in early 2021, and Chris Loyd joined in
        spring 2025. Multi-instrumentalist Jake Waylon contributed vocals,
        guitar, mandolin, harmonica, and keys from 2022 until spring 2025.
        <br />
        <br />
        Momentum continues to surge with recent signings to Edgewater Music
        Group for major label distribution and Western Grunge Records for
        management, booking, and promotion, signaling high expectations for
        what’s ahead.
        <br />
        <br />
        With Dark Skies, Memphis Kee shows they are more than just part of the
        Red Dirt and Americana scene - they are setting their own pace, forging
        their own path. The album puts their tenacious, unflinchingly honest,
        and hard-earned songwriting front and center, marking them as a band
        that belongs in the conversation about where the scene is going next.
        <br />
        <br />
        “When you keep pushing forward, time has a way of honing things. And it
        has done that with us. For the first time, Memphis Kee is five musicians
        moving in the same direction at the same speed. We've passed the point
        of figuring out who we are. With this record, we hope that now is the
        time that everyone else finds that out as well.”
